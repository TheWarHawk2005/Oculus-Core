# Oculus-Core

Oculus Core is totally free and open source. It is an in-browser text editor, so you can bookmark it. It's kinda like Notepad, but nicer looking, I think.  It's super simple, with just a few basic features like Name, Download, Copy, etc.

This wasn't even supposed to come as far as it did. I only started this project as an exercise in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (As you will see if you download this, I'm a horrible programmer). 

The other reason is that something like a fifth of the code is from places like https://w3schools.com/ . So tons of credit to them.

With that said, Oculus Core did go farther than the average exercise in inputs, CSS styling, and functions. If you'd like to help out, feel free to edit the file and submit it to me. I'd love to implement your work (with due credit on the website :).

# How to install

Installation is easy: Just download the zip and extract it. Next, open the many succesive folders untill you find "index.html". 

Run that, and bookmark it in your web browser. (Quick tip: Oculus Core was designed to work best with Google Chrome, and was not tested on any other browser. The only thing that I can think of going wrong would be some little CSS problems, however).
